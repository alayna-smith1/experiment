    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1> <!--Questions I want them to ask me out, that I want to answer. That I feel represent me.-->

<div id="interesting"></div>

    <h2>What is the most interesting thing about you?</h2>
        <p>        
            Since I learned the word in 7th grade, I have always wanted to become a polyglot. I currently speak fluent german and intermediate spanish. I will speak french, italain/portugese, and russian/chinese. TBD. As well, I am love learning, so I have set a goal to read 1 book per week, and nearly every week, 
            write up a powerpoint summary of the key takeways. Sometimes, I simply write powerpoints about thoughts that caught my attention for the week: for instance, "How Nephi demonstrates the 10x Rule".
        </p>

<div id="passionate"></div>

    <h2>What is something you're passionate about?</h2>
        <p>
            I am passionate about maximizing my health, specifically using food as a means of nourishment. I love listening to books and podcasts (usually at the gym/on a run) on physiology and nutrient metabolism, particularly for high performance athletes.
            My current personal favorites are "The Proof" by Simon Hill, and "Fiber Fueled".
        </p>

<div id="proud"></div>

    <h2>What is something you're proud of?</h2>
        <p>
            I am proud of my consistency with my fitness and health goals. For the past 9 weeks (Oct 15 - Dec 15), 
            I have maintatined a streak of hitting my macronutrient goals nearly every single day. 
            In addition, I have built a rock-solid habit of daily exercise (sometimes two sessions, to decompress in the evenings) over the past 18 months.
            From a nutritional standpoint, I aim to include as many whole foods as possible, focusing on nutrient density and variety.
        </p>

<div id="not-proud"></div>

    <h2>What is something you're not proud of? How has that shaped you?</h2>
        <p>
            For years, I have struggled to be punctual to meetings and in-person commitments. Homework and project deadlines? Almost never late. But 9am church meetings, and 
            I find myself leaving the house at 9am. On my mission, I learned by necessity to plan ahead and leave room for error. I am much-improved in punctuality comparatively, 
            however, this is still an area that I can improve on. I want to model respect in word and deed, particularly how I treat others' time, whether I get in trouble or not.
