    <h1>Welcome to Alayna's Professional Page!</h1>
    <p>On this page, you find what makes me who I am, my professional and core goals, and my qualifying experiences.
        Ultimately, if our core values and missions align, I would love to connect with you.</p>

    <div class="mission">

        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
            My mission is to joyfully magnify my stewardships by living with loving intentionality — strengthening my
            relationship with God, uplifting those I serve, and empowering others to draw closer to Him. As a wife and
            mother, I will create faith-centered places that invite peace and acceptance. As a professional, I will lead
            with integrity, diligence, and excellence.
            As a master gatherer, I lead with love, ambition, and purpose; I work diligently to develop my body, mind,
            and spirit, that I may be a light to others, helping them find their worth, hope, and divine potential.

        <div class="story">
            <p>
                When I know something is right, I will do it. While serving a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of
                Latter-day Saints, I practiced this mantra daily.
                Early on, I learned that is applies, whether I feel like doing the thing or not. On one sunny day, while
                enjoying some of the little free-time I had during the week, (a time where I generally relaxed and chose
                not engage with others) I felt a strong impression to approach a woman sitting on a bench next to me.
                At first, I resented the idea, as I was in the middle of my lunch - carrot in hand - and more
                significantly, since I wasn't "required" to do any missionary work at that time. However, the question,
                "what sign would you like to give to the Lord?" popped in my mind, and I realized that above all else,
                how I act is
                always noted by God. With this in mind, I got up, started a conversation with the woman, and made a
                connection that grew for another 6+ months; our friendship stood out above all other interactions on my
                mission and built my testimony of God's love for each of His children. I never want to give up an
                opportunity to do the right thing,
                simply because it is inconvenient.

                <p>
                    A leader in my life growing up once told me, "I will never not do something just because I am
                    scared." I took that personal rule to heart and ran with it.
                    Because of it, I chose to volunteer as my high school's concert choir accompanist, even though
                    nothing scared me more than sight-reading and playing in that setting.
                    Because of that choice, I decided to go out and sell door-to-door as a 21-year old, just 5 months
                    off of my mission, with no sales experience, or any friends on the team.
                    Because of it, I chose to show up nearly every week to iHub Networking and Treehouse Events (events
                    catered to entrepreurs) without any social connections or personal business to relate to others
                    there.
                    That choice also led me to run my first half-marathon, which led to a marathon a few months ago, and
                    a triathlon that I will complete in March 2026.
                    These experiences have deeply shaped who I am today, and continue to guide me in my everyday and
                    long-term decision-making.

                <!--story about compound effect... how i saw it in my life as a pianist. I am prepared to see no results for things that matter to me for a long time. "water the grass in front of me... willing to focus on what i have vs. what i haven't yet"-->
                <div class="story">
                    <p>
                        I believe in the law of compounding. Small, consistent actions over time lead to remarkable
                        results. I first learned this as a pianist,
                        having studied the instrument since age 6, eventually taking that passion through my first year
                        of college on-scholarship. Daily drills on the same boring scales, arpeggios, and passages
                        seemed repetitive and unhelpful for years.
                        However, especially as I dialed-in my tehcnique in college, I rapidly witnessed the reward of
                        those drills in my performance and ability to quickly apply my professor's feedback.
                        Now, I am prepared to see no results for things that matter to me for a long time, as I trust
                        the process. What takes muscles months to build, may show up suddenly in performance, and builds
                        consistnecy and reliability. I focus on "watering the grass in front of me," choosing to focus
                        on what I have versus what I haven't.
                        As Grant Cardone - one of my inspirations - says, "Everything worth doing is worth doing
                        everyday."

                        <p>
                            We are all in the people business. As the apostle Paul wrote,
                            <br>
                        <p class="quote">“And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body
                            to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.” - 1 Corinthians 13:3</p>
                        <br>
                        I believe we are all here to use our lives to build and create, lifting others up in the
                        process. The question, "Who will you bring with you?" reminds me that life is better when it's
                        shared.
                        Throughout my life, I learned that one of my greatest strengths (and dare I say, callings) is to
                        gather poeple. Food is love, and I have seen it build bridges of understanding and compassion
                        that surpass communication.
                        In high school, I spent cooked nearly every night for my family (as my mom hated cooking). I
                        then spent sunday afternon bakinga and delivering treat to neighbors I did not know.
                        The same on my mission. Most meaningful as been the friendships I've built over gatherings in
                        college. Below, is a picture from my latest two gatherings, the "International Cheux Pastry
                        Night", and our "Thanksgiviing Challah Bread Night".
                        Through these events, I connected groups of people I love, and got to know them in a more
                        relaxed setting.

                                You are what you eat. In order to magnify my stewardships, I believe it of the utmost
                                importance to consistently evaluate the various inputs in my life that influence my ways
                                of thinking and being.
                                As such, each morning I begin the day the same: waking up early, reading scriptures, and
                                journaling. I write out my vision, who I am, and what opportunities I have. I use this
                                to create goals that are always meaningful and a priority.
                                Additionally, on a frequent basis, I evaluate the media I consume. My goal is to ever
                                increase the wholesome around me, releasing the negative influences that do not serve me
                                well. Below is a sample of the media influence that I invite in my life.
